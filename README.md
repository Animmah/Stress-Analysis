# Stress-Analysis
This repository consists of a code that can be used to calculate various stresses acting on any body in an arbitrary plane, principal plane and octahedral plane (plane in which shear stresses are zero).
Object oriented programming was used in C++ language.
The purpose of this code was to overcome complicated and time consuming hand calculations, more over it is accurate and reliable.
